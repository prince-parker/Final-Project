Using Sprague Dawley rats, the present study explored the impact of limited resource availability on maternal behavior and physiological and emotional behavior outcomes in the offspring. Early life adversity was induced by incorporating aspects of the Limited Bedding and Nesting (LBN) and Scarcity models, wherein limited resource availability has previously been shown to provoke unpredictable or adverse maternal care, respectively. In our hands, Neonatal Limited Bedding (NLB) stress during postnatal days (P)2–9 altered maternal care, augmenting pup­ directed behaviors and reducing self-directed behaviors, and modestly increased the frequency of transitions between discrete behaviors across consecutive timed observations. NLB-exposed pups had lower core body temperatures immediately following the stressful manipulation and exhibited decreased body weight gain across development. However, NLB exposure did not impact adult offspring’s social or emotional behavior outcomes in the three-chamber social interaction test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, splash test, or forced swim test. These findings add to literature demonstrating that early life adversity impacts maternal care in rodents and can disrupt certain metabolic and thermoregulatory outcomes in the offspring.},

              While persistence of fear memories is essential for survival, a failure to inhibit fear in response to harmless stimuli is a feature of anxiety disorders. Extinction training only temporarily suppresses fear memory recovery in adults, but it is highly effective in juvenile rodents. Maturation of GABAergic circuits, in particular of parvalbumin-positive (PV

              ) cells, restricts plasticity in the adult brain, thus reducing PV
              +
              cell maturation could promote the suppression of fear memories following extinction training in adults. Epigenetic modifications such as histone acetylation control gene accessibility for transcription and help couple synaptic activity to changes in gene expression. Histone deacetylase 2 (Hdac2), in particular, restrains both structural and functional synaptic plasticity. However, whether and how Hdac2 controls the maturation of postnatal PV

              Acan
              , a critical perineuronal net component, which is rescued by Hdac2 re-expression. Pharmacological inhibition of Hdac2 before extinction training is sufficient to reduce both spontaneous fear memory recovery and

As reviewed in Chapter 2, they are responsible for most of the useful energy derived from the breakdown of carbohydrates and fatty acids, which is converted to ATP by the process of oxidative phosphorylation. Most mitochondrial proteins are translated on free cytosolic ribosomes and imported into the organelle by specific targeting signals. In addition, mitochondria are unique among the cytoplasmic organelles already discussed in that they contain their own DNA, which encodes tRNAs, rRNAs, and some mitochondrial proteins. The assembly of mitochondria thus involves proteins encoded by their own genomes and translated within the organelle, as well as proteins encoded by the nuclear genome and imported from the cytosol.},

            The current study provides evidence of early and persistent alterations in anxious behavior and amygdala function following the early-life stress of disorganized parental care. These changes in both brain and behavior are not diminished when the stressor is removed nor diminished with the development of prefrontal regulatory regions. The findings underscore the importance of early-life experiences on later development and highlight the need for early intervention for populations at-risk following early-life stressors.
          , 
            Relatively little is known about neurobiological changes attributable to early-life stressors (e.g., orphanage rearing), even though they have been associated with a heightened risk for later psychopathology. Human neuroimaging and animal studies provide complementary insights into the neural basis of problem behaviors following stress, but too often are limited by dissimilar experimental designs. The current mouse study manipulates the type and timing of a stressor to parallel the early-life stress experience of orphanage rearing, controlling for genetic and environmental confounds inherent in human studies. The results provide evidence of both early and persistent alterations in amygdala circuitry and function following early-life stress. These effects are not reversed when the stressor is removed nor diminished with the development of prefrontal regulation regions. These neural and behavioral findings are similar to our human findings in children adopted from orphanages abroad in that even following removal from the orphanage, the ability to suppress attention toward potentially threatening information in favor of goal-directed behavior was diminished relative to never-institutionalized children. Together, these findings highlight how early-life stress can lead to altered brain circuitry and emotion dysregulation that may increase the risk for psychopathology.},

Moreover, the structure of the CA2 PN population activity enables CA2 to generalize along categories of rewarded versus unrewarded and social versus non-social odor stimuli.

	abstract = {Abstract
            Early life adversity (ELA) is a major risk factor for mental illness, but the neurobiological mechanisms by which ELA increases the risk for future psychopathology are still poorly understood. Brain development is particularly malleable during prenatal and early postnatal life, when complex neural circuits are being formed and refined through an interplay of excitatory and inhibitory neural input, synaptogenesis, synaptic pruning, myelination, and neurogenesis. Adversity that influences these processes during sensitive periods of development can thus have long-lasting and pervasive effects on neural circuit maturation. In this review, we will discuss clinical and preclinical evidence for the impact of ELA on neural circuit formation with a focus on the early postnatal period, and how long-lasting impairments in these circuits can affect future behavior. We provide converging evidence from human and animal studies on how ELA alters the functional development of brain regions, neural circuits, and neurotransmitter systems that are crucial for cognition and affective behavior, including the hippocampus, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, neural networks of fear responses and cognition, and the serotonin (5-HT) system. We also discuss how gene-by-environment (GxE) interactions can determine individual differences in susceptibility and resilience to ELA, as well as molecular pathways by which ELA regulates neural circuit development, for which we emphasize epigenetic mechanisms. Understanding the molecular and neurobiological mechanisms underlying ELA effects on brain function and psychopathology during early postnatal sensitive periods may have great potential to advance strategies to better treat or prevent psychiatric disorders that have their origin early in life.},

	abstract = {Early life adversity impairs normal hippocampal function and connectivity in various mammalian species, including humans and rodents. According to the ‘cumulative model’ the number of early adversities can be summed up to determine the risk for developing psychopathology later in life. In contrast, the ‘dimensional model’ argues that ‘Deprivation’ and ‘Threat’ impact different developmental processes that should not be added in determining clinical outcomes. Here we examine these predictions in male and female mice exposed to a single adversity — limited bedding (LB) — versus mice exposed to multiple adversities — unpredictable postnatal stress (UPS) — focusing on microglia-mediated synaptic pruning in the developing hippocampus. Exposure to both LB and UPS reduced the ramification of microglia, impaired their ability to phagocytose synaptic material in vivo and ex vivo, and decreased expression of TREM2. Abnormal phagocytic activity was associated with increased spine density in CA1 pyramidal neurons that was seen in 17-day-old groups and persisted in peri-pubescent 29day-old LB and UPS mice. Exposure to LB caused more severe impairment in microglial ramification and synaptic engulfment compared to UPS, outcomes that were accompanied by a UPS-specific increase in the expression of several genes implicated in synaptic pruning. We propose that despite being a single stressor, LB represents a more severe form of early deprivation, and that appropriate levels of hippocampal stimulation during the second and third weeks of life are necessary to support normal microglial ramification and synaptic pruning. Further, impaired synaptic pruning during this critical period of hippocampal development contributes to the abnormal hippocampal function and connectivity seen in UPS and LB later in life.},

In the present study, we investigated the effects of daily RMS for 3 h and acute/single time MS (SMS) for 3 h on the plasma corticosterone level and c-Fos expression in the brain in mice at different postnatal ages. Mice were subjected to: (i) RMS from postnatal day (PND) 1 to 14 (RMS14); (ii) RMS from PND14 to 21 (RMS21); (iii) SMS on PND14 (SMS14); and (iv) SMS on PND21 (SMS21). Plasma corticosterone and c-Fos expression were examined on the ﬁnal day in each experiment. The basal corticosterone levels in RMS14 and RMS21 were equal to those in respective agematched controls. After the ﬁnal separation, the levels were signiﬁcantly increased and were comparable with those after SMS14 and SMS21, respectively. Histological analysis indicated that c-Fos expression signiﬁcantly increased in many brain regions, including the paraventricular nucleus, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and basolateral and medial amygdale in both SMS14 and SMS21 mice. However, c-Fos expression in RMS14 mice signiﬁcantly increased in many regions, whereas such increases were hardly seen in RMS21 mice. These results indicate that repeated early-life stress neither increases basal corticosterone, nor decreases the magnitude of the corticosterone response during the ﬁrst three postnatal weeks, although desensitisation of c-Fos expression induced by repeated stress is changed during postnatal development.},

	abstract = {Area CA2 is a critical region for diverse hippocampal functions including social recognition memory. This region has unique properties and connectivity. Notably, intra-hippocampal excitatory inputs to CA2 lack canonical long-term plasticity, but inhibitory transmission expresses a long-term depression mediated by Delta-opioid receptors (DOR-iLTDs). Evidence indicates that DOR-iLTDs are insufﬁcient to underlie social coding. Here, we report a novel inhibitory plasticity mediated by cannabinoid type 1 receptor activation (CB1R-iLTD). Surprisingly, CB1R-iLTD requires previous induction of DOR-iLTDs, indicating a permissive role for DOR plasticity. Blockade of CB1Rs in CA2 completely prevents social memory formation. Furthermore, the sequentiality of DOR- and CB1R-mediated plasticity occurs in vivo during successive social interactions. Finally, CB1R-iLTD is altered in a mouse model of schizophrenia with impaired social cognition but is rescued by a manipulation that also rescues social memory. Altogether, our data reveal a unique interplay between two inhibitory plasticities and a novel mechanism for social memory formation.},

            Recognizing an individual and retrieving and updating the value information assigned to the individual are fundamental abilities for establishing social relationships. To understand the neural mechanisms underlying the association between social identity and reward value, we developed Go-NoGo social discrimination paradigms that required male subject mice to distinguish between familiar mice based on their individually unique characteristics and associate them with reward availability. We found that mice could discriminate individual conspecifics through a brief nose-to-nose investigation, and this ability depended on the dorsal hippocampus. Two-photon calcium imaging revealed that dorsal CA1 hippocampal neurons represented reward expectation during social, but not non-social tasks, and these activities were maintained over days regardless of the identity of the associated mouse. Furthermore, a dynamically changing subset of hippocampal CA1 neurons discriminated between individual mice with high accuracy. Our findings suggest that the neuronal activities in CA1 provide possible neural substrates for associative social memory.},

	abstract = {Background: The relationship of health risk behavior and disease in adulthood to the breadth of exposure to childhood emotional, physical, or sexual abuse, and household dysfunction during childhood has not previously been described.
Methods: A questionnaire about adverse childhood experiences was mailed to 13,494 adults who had completed a standardized medical evaluation at a large HMO; 9,508 (70.5\%) responded. Seven categories of adverse childhood experiences were studied: psychological, physical, or sexual abuse; violence against mother; or living with household members who were substance abusers, mentally ill or suicidal, or ever imprisoned. The number of categories of these adverse childhood experiences was then compared to measures of adult risk behavior, health status, and disease. Logistic regression was used to adjust for effects of demographic factors on the association between the cumulative number of categories of childhood exposures (range: 0 –7) and risk factors for the leading causes of death in adult life.
Results: More than half of respondents reported at least one, and one-fourth reported Ն2 categories of childhood exposures. We found a graded relationship between the number of categories of childhood exposure and each of the adult health risk behaviors and diseases that were studied (P Ͻ .001). Persons who had experienced four or more categories of childhood exposure, compared to those who had experienced none, had 4to 12-fold increased health risks for alcoholism, drug abuse, depression, and suicide attempt; a 2- to 4-fold increase in smoking, poor self-rated health, Ն50 sexual intercourse partners, and sexually transmitted disease; and a 1.4- to 1.6-fold increase in physical inactivity and severe obesity. The number of categories of adverse childhood exposures showed a graded relationship to the presence of adult diseases including ischemic heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, skeletal fractures, and liver disease. The seven categories of adverse childhood experiences were strongly interrelated and persons with multiple categories of childhood exposure were likely to have multiple health risk factors later in life.
Conclusions: We found a strong graded relationship between the breadth of exposure to abuse or household dysfunction during childhood and multiple risk factors for several of the leading causes of death in adults.},

	abstract = {Romantic and maternal love are highly rewarding experiences. Both are linked to the perpetuation of the species and therefore have a closely linked biological function of crucial evolutionary importance. The newly developed ability to study the neural correlates of subjective mental states with brain imaging techniques has allowed neurobiologists to learn something about the neural bases of both romantic and maternal love. Both types of attachment activate regions speciﬁc to each, as well as overlapping regions in the brain’s reward system that coincide with areas rich in oxytocin and vasopressin receptors. Both deactivate a common set of regions associated with negative emotions, social judgment and ‘mentalizing’ that is, the assessment of other people’s intentions and emotions. Human attachment seems therefore to employ a push–pull mechanism that overcomes social distance by deactivating networks used for critical social assessment and negative emotions, while it bonds individuals through the involvement of the reward circuitry, explaining the power of love to motivate and exhilarate. Yet the biological study of love, and especially romantic love, must go beyond and look for biological insights that can be derived from studying the world literature of love, and thus bring the output of the humanities into its orbit.},

“neurobiologists of the future will also be looking into evidence derived from the world literature of love, since that literature is itself a product of the brain and its careful study gives strong hints about how the romantic system in the brain is organized.” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2575)
First studies - “These studies showed that, when we look at the face of someone we are deeply, passionately and hopelessly in love with, a limited number of areas in the brain are especially engaged.” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2575)
Emotional Brain
“Three of these areas are in the cerebral cortex itself and several others are located in subcortical stations.” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2575)
“The areas that are involved are, in the cortex, the medial insula, anterior cingulate, and hippocampus and, in the subcortex, parts of the striatum and probably also the nucleus accumbens” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2575)
“areas that are activated in response to romantic feelings are largely coextensive with those brain regions that contain high concentrations of a neuro-modulator that is associated with reward, desire, addiction and euphoric states, namely dopamine” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2575)
Dopamine is released by  the “hypothalamus, a structure located deep in the brain and functioning as a link between the nervous and endocrine systems” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2575)
“These same regions become active when exogenous opioid drugs such as cocaine, which themselves induce states of euphoria, are ingested” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2575)
“An increase in dopamine is coupled to a decrease in another neuro-modulator, serotonin (5-HT or 5hydroxytryptamine), which is linked to appetite and mood.” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2576)
Oxytocin and vasopressin - attachment and bonding (released by hypothalamus and stored in pituitary gland)
“anterior cingulate cortex” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2576)
lessening of fear - “amygdala. Increase in activity in the romantic core of areas is mirrored by a decrease in activity, or inactivation, of these cortical zones.” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2577)
“uspension of judgment” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2577)
Maternal v romantic love
“The commonly activated regions between the two types of love are located in the striatum, part of the reward system of the human brain.” (Zeki, 2007, p. 2577)

	abstract = {Cannabis sativa is one of the oldest cultivated plants. Many of the medicinal properties of cannabis are known, although very few cannabis-based formulations became prescribed drugs. Previous research demonstrated that cannabis varieties are very different in their medicinal properties, likely due to the entourage effect—the synergistic or antagonistic effect of various cannabinoids and terpenes. In this work, we analyzed 25 cannabis extracts containing high levels of delta-9tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). We used HCC1806 squamous cell carcinoma and demonstrated various degrees of efﬁciency of the tested extracts, from 66\% to 92\% of growth inhibition of cancer cells. Inﬂammation was tested by induction of inﬂammation with TNF-α/IFN-γ in WI38 human lung ﬁbroblasts. The efﬁciency of the extracts was tested by analyzing the expression of COX2 and IL6; while some extracts aggravated inﬂammation by increasing the expression of COX2/IL6 by 2-fold, other extracts decreased inﬂammation, reducing expression of cytokines by over 5-fold. We next analyzed the level of THC, CBD, CBG and CBN and twenty major terpenes and performed clustering and association analysis between the chemical composition of the extracts and their efﬁciency in inhibiting cancer growth and curbing inﬂammation. A positive correlation was found between the presence of terpinene (pval = 0.002) and anti-cancer property; eucalyptol came second, with pval of 0.094. p-cymene and β-myrcene positively correlated with the inhibition of IL6 expression, while camphor correlated negatively. No signiﬁcant correlation was found for COX2. We then performed a correlation analysis between cannabinoids and terpenes and found a positive correlation for the following pairs: α-pinene vs. CBD, p-cymene vs. CBGA, terpenolene vs. CBGA and isopulegol vs. CBGA. Our work, thus, showed that most of high-THC extracts demonstrate anti-cancer activity, while only certain selected extracts showed anti-inﬂammatory activity. Presence of certain terpenes, such as terpinene, eucalyptol, cymene, myrcene and camphor, appear to have modulating effects on the activity of cannabinoids.},

	abstract = {Grief is a process provoked as a response to different losses, such as death, loss of job, relationship breakdown, some unexpected life events and changes, etc. The experiences of loss and bereavement are very individual. Even though loss is expected, the person feels traumatized, especially if death is provoked by violence, natural disasters, or war. This pandemic, like other disasters (wars, tsunami, earthquakes, floods, etc.) has provoked intensive reactions of grief, reactions that could persist for years. The core symptoms of grief are described in the ICD-11 and DSM-5 manuals. The term “complicated grief” in the medical sense refers to a superimposed process that alters grief and modifies its course for the worse. Prolonged grief disorder (PGD) is characterized by normal grief symptoms, but these are symptoms that remain too intense for too long of a period. This article is a review of the manifestations and duration of grief in different occasions, and it is based on over 50 published papers, and discoveries in the Medline and Psych-Net databases. Commonly described reactions to grief are: shock, disbelief or denial, a high level of anxiety, distress, anger, sadness, insomnia, and a loss of appetite. As predictors for a high/slow decreasing trajectory of grief process are: female gender, reported symptoms of depression before the traumatic event, and higher scores on avoidance. However, grief is transient, even as we are is in the midst of its clutches. People should expect to fluctuate between moments of sadness and mourning, and moments of acceptance, or even happiness for being alive. Researchers suppose that when a crisis passes; most people will be able to bounce back and move on with their lives.},

	abstract = {Humans continually face situations that require actions to achieve valued goals with meaningful consequences at stake. Although the pursuit of such goals can be a negatively “stressful” experience, it is not necessarily so. According to the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat, evaluations of personal resources and situational demands determine to what extent individuals experience a relatively positive (challenge) versus negative (threat) psychological state in this context. Challenge occurs when evaluated resources meet or exceed demands, whereas threat occurs when demands exceed resources. The challenge response thus reﬂects resilience in the face of potential stress. Because challenge and threat reliably result in distinct patterns of physiological changes, assessing cardiovascular responses in particular can provide valuable insight into underlying psychological processes. Research applying this methodology to individual differences (e.g., self-esteem level and stability and cumulative lifetime exposure to adversity) has implications for understanding how early life experience could contribute to resilience versus vulnerability to potential stress in daily life.},

Perceptions of social isolation, or loneliness, increase vigilance for threat and heighten feelings of vulnerability while also raising the desire to reconnect. Implicit hypervigilance for social threat alters psychological processes that influence physiological functioning, diminish sleep quality, and increase morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this paper is to review the features and consequences of loneliness within a comprehensive theoretical framework that informs interventions to reduce loneliness. We review physical and mental health consequences of loneliness, mechanisms for its effects, and effectiveness of extant interventions. Features of a loneliness regulatory loop are employed to explain cognitive, behavioral, and physiological consequences of loneliness and to discuss interventions to reduce loneliness. Loneliness is not simply being alone. Interventions to reduce loneliness and its health consequences may need to take into account its attentional, confirmatory, and memorial biases as well as its social and behavioral effects.},

Disgust was induced in Experiment 1 by exposure to a bad smell, in Experiment 2 by working in a disgusting room, in Experiment 3 by recalling a physically disgusting experience, and in Experiment 4 through a video induction. In each case, the results showed that disgust can increase the severity of moral judgments relative to controls. Experiment 4 found that disgust had a different effect on moral judgment than did sadness. In addition, Experiments 2-4 showed that the role of disgust in severity of moral judgments depends on participants' sensitivity to their own bodily sensations. Taken together, these data indicate the importance—and specificity—of gut feelings in moral judgments.},

“In this article we cannot say whether people ought to follow their feelings of disgust; we are concerned with whether they actually do use such feelings to guide their judgments and with the limiting conditions on such use.” (Schnall et al., 2008, p. 1096)
“When making evaluative judgments, people attend to their own feelings, as if asking themselves: How do I feel about it? Thus, consistent with Hume’s statement, people generally like what they feel good about and dislike what they feel bad about.” (Schnall et al., 2008, p. 1097)
“First, are all moral judgments influenced by disgust or only those that contain actions involving physical disgust?
Second, are other, nonmoral judgments affected as well?
Third, is the effect driven by emotional feelings or activated concepts of disgust?
Fourth, does any negative emotion (e.g., sadness) make moral judgments more severe, or is there something special about disgust?” (Schnall et al., 2008, p. 1097)
To what extent do individuals rely on intuition when objective truth suggests that these evaluative affections may be incorrect or even immoral? I suppose the answer may be partially found in the level of attachment to a certain belief or belief system and the role it plays in one’s general understanding, but at what point do these moral judgements surrender to evidence based in empirical investigation? These inductions may offer some reconciliation on moral issues related to abortion rights and anti-vaccination movements today.

It first considers the standard assumption in theories of purposive action across the social sciences that deliberation precedes action. It then discusses three decisions that a person inherently makes when he or she mobilizes his or her network: to seek help, to select a confidant, and to activate the tie. The chapter suggests that the extent to which their activation decisions were incidental or spontaneous, rather than reflective, depended in part on the context of students’ interactions with others. It argues that students often found themselves confiding in someone not because they had planned it, but simply because the confidant was present and available when needed.},

We present data on the contemporary second generation and review the challenges that it confronts in seeking adaptation to American society. The concept of segmented assimilation is introduced to describe the diverse possible outcomes of this process of adaptation.

I argue that a key dilemma for intersectionality researchers is that the additive (e.g., Black + Lesbian + Woman) versus intersectional (e.g., Black Lesbian Woman) assumption inherent in measurement and qualitative and quantitative data analyses contradicts the central tenet of intersectionality: social identities and inequality are interdependent for groups such as Black lesbians, not mutually exclusive. In light of this, interpretation becomes one of the most substantial tools in the intersectionality researcher’s methodological toolbox.},

	abstract = {Background: Racial disparities in birth outcomes persist in North Carolina and the United States. We examined patterns of birth outcomes and women’s health measures in North Carolina by race and age to portray the largest disparities. We wanted to see if our data were consistent with the “weathering hypothesis,” which holds that the health of African American women may begin to deteriorate in early adulthood, with negative effects on birth outcomes.
Methods: We conducted a descriptive analysis of 1999-2003 North Carolina live birth and infant death records and 2001-2003 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System survey data. Birth outcome measures examined were low birth weight, very low birth weight, infant mortality, neonatal mortality, and postneonatal mortality. Women’s health measures examined were obesity, self-reported health status, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, current smoking, and smoking during pregnancy. Rates for whites and African Americans were compared for each of three age groups.
Results: Racial disparities in birth outcomes increase with increasing maternal age. African American teens often experience better birth outcomes than older African American women. Racial disparities in measures of women’s health also increase with increasing age.
Conclusions: Health problems among older African American women of reproductive age may contribute substantially to racial disparities in birth outcomes. Improving the health of older African American women may be an effective strategy to reduce the overall racial disparities in birth outcomes.},

Butler’s description of the heterosexual contract reminds me of the movie “Chiraq” where women utilize their reproductive power to combat gun violence among men.
Established performances, ideas, and expectations surrounding gender maintain themselves through “regulatory and punitive conventions” (Page 10). De Beauvoir also explains a similar mechanism through the oppressor-oppressed relationship. How are notions propagated by an oppressing population dismantled when the opportunity is sparsely given to the oppressed to disprove stereotypes? Is assimilation to established sociocultural norms required to do so?

Using research with Black lesbians (Bowleg, manuscripts in preparation; Bowleg et al., Journal of Lesbian Studies, 2008; Bowleg et al., Cultural Diversity \& Ethnic Minority Psychology 10:229–240, 2004; Bowleg et al., Journal of Lesbian Studies, 7:87–108, 2003) as a foundation, I examine how these challenges shape measurement, analysis, and interpretation. I argue that a key dilemma for intersectionality researchers is that the additive (e.g., Black + Lesbian + Woman) versus intersectional (e.g., Black Lesbian Woman) assumption inherent in measurement and qualitative and quantitative data analyses contradicts the central tenet of intersectionality: social identities and inequality are interdependent for groups such as Black lesbians, not mutually exclusive. In light of this, interpretation becomes one of the most substantial tools in the intersectionality researcher’s methodological toolbox.},

In this article, the African American reproductive disadvantage is discussed within the context of American race relations. The review of the literature focuses on racism as a social determinant of race-based disparities in adverse birth outcomes with specific attention to the viability of genetic explanations, the role of socioeconomic factors, the multidimensional nature of racism, and the stress-induced physiologic pathways by which racism may negatively affect pregnancy.

We propose that androcentric, ethnocentric, and heterocentric ideologies will cause people who have multiple subordinategroup identities to be defined as non-prototypical members of their respective identity groups. Because people with multiple subordinate-group identities (e.g., ethnic minority woman) do not fit the prototypes of their respective identity groups (e.g., ethnic minorities, women), they will experience what we have termed “intersectional invisibility.” In this article, our model of intersectional invisibility is developed and evidence from historical narratives, cultural representations, interest-group politics, and anti-discrimination legal frameworks is used to illustrate its utility.

“The term “double jeopardy” is traditionally used by scholars who emphasize the cumulative disadvantage that accrues to people with multiple subordinate-group identities” (Purdie-Vaughns and Eibach, 2008, p. 378)
Smth - makes sense for minority men to experience more prejudice than minority women at the time this was written, but women have new roles in society that are not necessarily bound by gender (new workplace opportunities to be discriminated against by both minority men and white men), this hypothesis does align with intersectional invisibility though. Are Black men a greater threat to white men’s social power than Black women.
“A meta-analysis of employment discrimination auditing studies conducted in several different countries revealed that the bias favoring domiSex Roles (2008) 59:377–391 37” (Purdie-Vaughns and Eibach, 2008, p. 379) ---- is this because both sets of women are awarded job opportunities overall?
The authors do well to highlight the futility in comparative suffering as it relates to nonprototypical identities. Specific attention is also given to how what is considered prototypical is context-dependent: “people generally consider men to be prototypical voters and college professors, but they consider women to be prototypical grade school teachers” (Page 13). The lack of contexts in which Black women exemplify prototypicality emphasizes the invisibility described throughout this article. What are some situations where Black women are considered prototypical and do these contexts challenge or fortify existing stereotypes?
Statistically, Black women are the most educated group in the United States, but are still not recognized in the academic context to this extent.

Yet our review of recently published empirical articles reveals that demographic gender measurement in psychology still assumes that gender comprises just two categories: women and men. This common practice is problematic. It fails to represent psychologists' current understanding of gender, violates our ethical principles as scientists, and can result in gender misclassification. Psychologists' reliance on binary measures also conveys an exclusionary attitude that is contrary to recent ethical recommendations and contrary to the growing public concern about transgender rights. We extend five simple, no-cost recommendations that begin to resolve these ethical and methodological problems: use and report, nonbinary gender measures; report the prevalence of nonbinary participants; clarify their inclusion and treatment in analysis; and use gender inclusive language. We also address common concerns expressed by researchers, including whether measuring “sex” resolves the issue and whether gender-inclusive measures confuse or offend participants.},

	abstract = {Objectives: We examine associations between infant mortality rates (IMRs) and measures of structural racism and socio-economic marginalization in Chicago, Illinois. Our purpose was to determine whether the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) was signiﬁcantly related to community-level IMRs. Study design: We use a cross-sectional ecological public health design to examine community-level factors related to IMRs in Chicago neighborhoods.
Methods: We use data from the Chicago Department of Public Health and the American Community Survey to examine IMR inequities during the period 2012e2016. Calculations of the ICE for race and income were undertaken. In addition, we calculated racialized socio-economic status, which is the concentration of afﬂuent Whites relative to poor Blacks in a community area. We present these ICE measures, as well as hardship, percent of births with inadequate prenatal care (PNC), and the percent of single-parent households as quintiles so that we can compare neighborhoods with the most disadvantage with neighborhoods with the least. Negative binomial regression was used to determine whether the ICE measures were independently related to community IMRs, net of hardship scores, PNC, and single-parent households.
Results: Spearman correlation results indicate signiﬁcant associations in Chicago communities between measures of racial segregation and economic marginalization and IMRs. Community areas with the lowest ICERace scores (those with the largest concentrations of Black residents, compared with White) had IMRs that were 3.63 times higher than those communities with the largest concentrations of White residents. Most associations between community IMRS and measures of structural racism and socioeconomic marginalization are accounted for in fully adjusted negative binomial regression models. Only ICERace remained signiﬁcantly related to IMRs.
Conclusions: We show that structural racism as represented by the ICE is independently related to IMRs in Chicago; community areas with the largest concentrations of Blacks residents compared with Whites are those with the highest IMRs. This relationship persists even after controlling for socio-economic marginalization, hardship, household composition/family support, and healthcare access. Interventions to improve birth outcomes must address structural determinants of health inequities.},

The appearance of each facial feature has an effect on our perception of facial traits. This research addresses the problem of measuring the size of these effects for five facial features (eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, and jaw). Our proposal is a mixed feature-based and image-based approach that allows judgments to be made on complete real faces in the categorization tasks, more than on synthetic, noisy, or partial faces that can influence the assessment. Each facial feature of the faces is automatically classified considering their global appearance using principal component analysis. Using this procedure, we establish a reduced set of relevant specific attributes (each one describing a complete facial feature) to characterize faces. In this way, a more direct link can be established between perceived facial traits and what people intuitively consider an eye, an eyebrow, a nose, a mouth, or a jaw. A set of 92 male faces were classified using this procedure, and the results were related to their scores in 15 perceived facial traits. We show that the relevant features greatly depend on what we are trying to judge. Globally, the eyes have the greatest effect. However, other facial features are more relevant for some judgments like the mouth for happiness and femininity or the nose for dominance.},

	abstract = {Research indicates that rejected individuals are better than others at discriminating between genuine (Duchenne) and deceptive (non-Duchenne) smiles (i.e., true versus false signals of afﬁliative opportunity). We hypothesized that rejected individuals would show a greater preference to work with individuals displaying Duchenne versus non-Duchenne smiles. To test this, participants wrote essays about experiences of inclusion, exclusion, or mundane events. They then saw a series of 20 videos of smiling individuals (10 with Duchenne and 10 with non-Duchenne smiles). Participants then indicated how much they would like to work with each target. Analyses revealed that compared to included and control participants, excluded individuals showed a greater preference to work with individuals displaying ‘‘real” as opposed to ‘‘fake” smiles. This effect was partially mediated by threats to ‘‘relational needs” (Williams, 2007) and fully mediated by threats to self-esteem. These results suggest that exclusion yields adaptive responses that could facilitate reconnection with others.},

	abstract = {The persistence of the black health disadvantage has been a puzzling component of health in the United States in spite of general declines in rates of morbidity and mortality over the past century. Studies that have focused on well-established individual-level determinants of health such as socio-economic status and health behaviors have been unable to fully explain these disparities. Recent research has begun to focus on other factors such as racism, discrimination, and segregation. Variation in neighborhood contextdsocio-demographic composition, social aspects, and built environmentdhas been postulated as an additional explanation for racial disparities, but few attempts have been made to quantify its overall contribution to the black/white health gap. This analysis is an attempt to generate an estimate of place effects on explaining health disparities by utilizing data from the U.S. National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (1989–1994), combined with a methodology for identifying residents of the same blocks both within and across NHIS survey crosssections. Our results indicate that controlling for a single point-in-time measure of residential context results in a roughly 15–76\% reduction of the black/white disparities in self-rated health that were previously unaccounted for by individual-level controls. The contribution of residential context toward explaining the black/white self-rated health gap varies by both age and gender such that contextual explanations of disparities decline with age and appear to be smaller among females.},

	abstract = {This study examined the interrelationship of race and socioeconomic status (SES) upon infant birthweight at the individual and neighborhood levels within a Midwestern US county marked by high Black infant mortality. The study conducted a multi-level analysis utilizing individual birth records and census tract datasets from 2010, linked through a spatial join with ArcGIS 10.0. The maternal population of 2861 Black and White women delivering infants in 2010, residing in 57 census tracts within the county, constituted the study samples. The main outcome was infant birthweight. The predictors, race and SES were dichotomized into Black and White, low-SES and higher-SES, at both the individual and census tract levels. A two-part Bayesian model demonstrated that individual-level race and SES were more inﬂuential birthweight predictors than community-level factors. Speciﬁcally, Black women had 1.6 higher odds of delivering a low birthweight (LBW) infant than White women, and low-SES women had 1.7 higher odds of delivering a LBW infant than higher-SES women. Moderate support was found for a three-way interaction between individual-level race, SES and community-level race, such that Black women achieved equity with White women (4.0\% Black LBW and 4.1\% White LBW) when they each had higher-SES and lived in a racially congruous neighborhood (e.g., Black women lived in disproportionately Black neighborhood and White women lived in disproportionately White neighborhood). In sharp contrast, Black women with higher-SES who lived in a racially incongruous neighborhood (e.g., disproportionately White) had the worst outcomes (14.5\% LBW). Demonstrating the layered inﬂuence of personal and community circumstances upon health, in a community with substantial racial disparities, personal race and SES independently contribute to birth outcomes, while environmental context, speciﬁcally neighborhood racial congruity, is associated with mitigated health risk.},

              increases

A substantial proportion (30–40\%, compared with 60–70\% in the standard ultimatum game) of those who responded rejected unfair offers even when rejection reduced only their own earnings to 0, while not affecting the earnings of the person who proposed the unfair split (in an impunity game). Furthermore, even when the responders were not able to communicate their anger to the proposers by rejecting unfair offers in a
              private
              impunity game, a similar rate of rejection was observed. The rejection of unfair offers that

              inequity cannot be explained by the social preference for inequity aversion or reciprocity; however, it does provide support for the model of emotion as a commitment device. In this view, emotions such as anger or moral disgust lead people to disregard the immediate consequences of their behavior, committing them to behave consistently to preserve integrity and maintain a reputation over time as someone who is reliably committed to this behavior.},

	title = {Romantic {Love}: {An} {fMRI} {Study} of a {Neural} {Mechanism} for {Mate} {Choice}},
	abstract = {Scientists have described myriad traits in mammalian and avian species that evolved to attract mates. But the brain mechanisms by which conspeciﬁcs become attracted to these traits is largely unknown. Yet mammals and birds express mate preferences and make mate choices, and data suggest that this “attraction system” is associated with the dopaminergic reward system. It has been proposed that intense romantic love, a cross-cultural universal, is a developed form of this attraction system. To determine the neural mechanisms associated with romantic love we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and studied 17 people who were intensely “in love” (Aron et al. [2005] J Neurophysiol 94:327–337). Activation speciﬁc to the beloved occurred in the right ventral tegmental area and right caudate nucleus, dopamine-rich areas associated with mammalian reward and motivation. These and other results suggest that dopaminergic reward pathways contribute to the “general arousal” component of romantic love; romantic love is primarily a motivation system, rather than an emotion; this drive is distinct from the sex drive; romantic love changes across time; and romantic love shares biobehavioral similarities with mammalian attraction. We propose that this attraction mechanism evolved to enable individuals to focus their mating energy on speciﬁc others, thereby conserving energy and facilitating mate choice—a primary aspect of reproduction. Last, the corticostriate system, with its potential for combining diverse cortical information with reward signals, is an excellent anatomical substrate for the complex factors contributing to romantic love and mate choice.

	abstract = {As reﬂected in the amount of controversy, few areas in psychology have undergone such dramatic conceptual changes in the past decade as the emerging science of heuristics. Heuristics are efﬁcient cognitive processes, conscious or unconscious, that ignore part of the information. Because using heuristics saves effort, the classical view has been that heuristic decisions imply greater errors than do “rational” decisions as deﬁned by logic or statistical models. However, for many decisions, the assumptions of rational models are not met, and it is an empirical rather than an a priori issue how well cognitive heuristics function in an uncertain world. To answer both the descriptive question (“Which heuristics do people use in which situations?”) and the prescriptive question (“When should people rely on a given heuristic rather than a complex strategy to make better judgments?”), formal models are indispensable. We review research that tests formal models of heuristic inference, including in business organizations, health care, and legal institutions. This research indicates that (a) individuals and organizations often rely on simple heuristics in an adaptive way, and (b) ignoring part of the information can lead to more accurate judgments than weighting and adding all information, for instance for low predictability and small samples. The big future challenge is to develop a systematic theory of the building blocks of heuristics as well as the core capacities and environmental structures these exploit.},

	abstract = {The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), developed by the National Institute of Mental Health as a neuroscienceinformed alternative to traditional psychiatric nosology, is an explicitly dimensional system in which classiﬁcation of psychopathology is derived inductively (i.e., from basic science), across multiple levels of analysis (e.g., genetic, neural, psychophysiological, and behavioral). Although RDoC is often presented as paradigmatically revolutionary, a review of the history of psychophysiology suggests that roots of RDoC thinking extend at least as far back as the mid-20th Century. In this paper, we brieﬂy and selectively review the historical emergence of neurobiologically-informed dimensional trait models of psychopathology, and we summarize our thinking regarding high frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) as a transdiagnostic biomarker of self-regulation and cognitive control. When functional interactions between HF-HRV and systems of behavioral approach and avoidance are considered, diverse patterns of behavioral maladjustment can be subsumed into a single model. This model accommodates the general bifactor structure of psychopathology, and suggests that HF-HRV can be viewed as an autonomic, transdiagnostic biomarker of mental illness.},

	abstract = {Anhedonia, the lack of pleasure, has been shown to be a critical feature of a range of psychiatric disorders. Yet, it is currently measured primarily through subjective self-reports and as such has been difﬁcult to submit to rigorous scientiﬁc analysis. New insights from affective neuroscience hold considerable promise in improving our understanding of anhedonia and for providing useful objective behavioral measures to complement traditional self-report measures, potentially leading to better diagnoses and novel treatments. Here, we review the state-of-the-art of hedonia research and speciﬁcally the established mechanisms of wanting, liking, and learning. Based on this framework we propose to conceptualize anhedonia as impairments in some or all of these processes, thereby departing from the longstanding view of anhedonia as solely reduced subjective experience of pleasure. We discuss how deﬁcits in each of the reward components can lead to different expressions, or subtypes, of anhedonia affording novel ways of measurement. Speciﬁcally, we review evidence suggesting that patients suffering from depression and schizophrenia show impairments in wanting and learning, while some aspects of conscious liking seem surprisingly intact. Furthermore, the evidence suggests that anhedonia is heterogeneous across psychiatric disorders, depending on which parts of the pleasure networks are most affected. This in turn has implications for diagnosis and treatment of anhedonia.},

	volume = {4},
	abstract = {Background: Of the putative psychopathological endophenotypes in major depressive disorder (MDD), the anhedonic subtype is particularly well supported. Anhedonia is generally assumed to reflect aberrant motivation and reward responsivity. However, research has been limited by a lack of objective measures of reward motivation. We present the Effort-Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT or ‘‘effort’’), a novel behavioral paradigm as a means of exploring effort-based decision-making in humans. Using the EEfRT, we test the hypothesis that effort-based decision-making is related to trait anhedonia.
Methods/Results: 61 undergraduate students participated in the experiment. Subjects completed self-report measures of mood and trait anhedonia, and completed the EEfRT. Across multiple analyses, we found a significant inverse relationship between anhedonia and willingness to expend effort for rewards.
Conclusions: These findings suggest that anhedonia is specifically associated with decreased motivation for rewards, and provide initial validation for the EEfRT as a laboratory-based behavioral measure of reward motivation and effort-based decision-making in humans.},

	abstract = {The neurovisceral integration model aims to account for the complex interplay between physiological, cognitive, and emotion regulation processes through their support by common cortico–subcortical neural circuits. According to the model, vagally mediated heart rate variability (HRV) serves as a peripheral index of the functioning of these circuits, with higher levels of resting HRV reflecting more optimal functioning, to support goal-directed behaviour and adaptability to environmental demands. Although increased cognitive flexibility has been related to higher resting HRV, this has not been assessed in the context of emotional information to examine the interplay between cognition and emotion. Therefore, we investigated (n = 109) the relationship between resting HRV and performance on a task-switching paradigm in which participants shift attention between affective and nonaffective aspects of emotional material. Resting HRV was not associated with flexibility in processing of positive material, but more efficient shifting of attention (greater flexibility) from affective to nonaffective aspects of negative information was related to lower resting HRV. The avoidance theory of worry and anxiety, as well as empirical evidence, links anxiety to attentional avoidance of negative information. Our findings therefore support the neurovisceral integration model such that when greater flexibility can facilitate attentional avoidance of negative information—as seen in anxiety—it is related to lower resting HRV.},

Here we explored the relationship between targets’ perceived social traits and how well they were remembered following a single brief perception, focusing primarily on inferences of trustworthiness. In Study 1, participants encoded high-consensus trustworthy and untrustworthy faces, showing signiﬁcantly better memory for the latter group. Study 2 compared memory for faces rated high and low on a series of traits (dominance, facial maturity, likeability, and trustworthiness), and found that untrustworthy and unlikeable faces were remembered best, with no differences for the other traits. Finally, Study 3 compared information about trustworthiness from facial appearance and from behavioral descriptions. Untrustworthy targets were remembered better than trustworthy targets both from behavior and faces, though the effects were signiﬁcantly stronger for the latter. Faces perceived as untrustworthy therefore appear to be remembered better than faces perceived as trustworthy. Consistent with ecological theories of perception, cues to trustworthiness from facial appearance may thus guide who is remembered and who is forgotten at ﬁrst impression.},

Furthermore, several studies in low and middle income countries have shown that lay health counselors can effectively deliver psychological therapies. Behavioral activation, a relatively simple form of therapy, has been found to be as effective as cognitive behavior therapy. Treatment of subthreshold depression has been found to not only reduce depressive symptoms but also prevent the onset of major depression. In addition, therapies are effective in older adults, patients with general medical disorders and in perinatal depression.},

In this paper, we provide a framework of how faces and contexts combine and describe possible meanings of consistent and inconsistent face-context pairings. We also discuss methodological caveats that should be considered in the conduct of such judgment studies. We argue that future research in this area will beneﬁt not from more studies of different combinations of stimuli created merely because we have the technological ability to create them, but instead from careful consideration of the ecological validity of the various types of combinations that can be produced, and their meaning.},

There are several deﬁnitions and staging models of TRD and a consensus for each has not yet been established. However, in common for each model is the inadequate response to at least 2 trials of antidepressant pharmacotherapy. In this review, a comprehensive analysis of existing literature regarding the challenges and management of TRD has been compiled. A PubMed search was performed to assemble meta-analyses, trials and reviews on the topic of TRD. First, we address the confounds in the deﬁnitions and staging models of TRD, and subsequently the difﬁculties inherent in assessing the illness. Pharmacological augmentation strategies including lithium, triiodothyronine and second-generation antipsychotics are reviewed, as is switching of antidepressant class. Somatic therapies, including several modalities of brain stimulation (electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy and deep brain stimulation) are detailed, psychotherapeutic strategies and subsequently novel therapeutics including ketamine, psilocybin, anti-inﬂammatories and new directions are reviewed in this manuscript. Our review of the evidence suggests that further large-scale work is necessary to understand the appropriate treatment pathways for TRD and to prescribe effective therapeutic options for patients suffering from TRD.},

Methods: Twenty patients with TRD underwent serial assessments before and after SCG DBS. We determined the percentage of patients who achieved a response (50\% or greater reduction in the 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression [HRSD-17]) or remission (scores of 7 or less) after surgery. We also examined changes in brain metabolism associated with DBS, using positron emission tomography.
Results: There were both early and progressive beneﬁts to DBS. One month after surgery, 35\% of patients met criteria for response with 10\% of patients in remission. Six months after surgery, 60\% of patients were responders and 35\% met criteria for remission, beneﬁts that were largely maintained at 12 months. Deep brain stimulation therapy was associated with speciﬁc changes in the metabolic activity localized to cortical and limbic circuits implicated in the pathogenesis of depression. The number of serious adverse effects was small with no patient experiencing permanent deﬁcits.
Conclusions: This study suggests that DBS is relatively safe and provides signiﬁcant improvement in patients with TRD. Subcallosal cingulate gyrus DBS likely acts by modulating brain networks whose dysfunction leads to depression. The procedure is well tolerated and beneﬁts are sustained for at least 1 year. A careful double-blind appraisal is required before the procedure can be recommended for use on a wider scale.},

The idea that AI might advance medicine’s understanding of biological categories of psychiatric disorders, as well as provide better treatments, is appealing given the historical challenges with prediction, diagnosis and treatment in psychiatry. Given the power of AI to analyse vast amounts of information, some clinicians may feel obligated to align their clinical judgements with the outputs of the AI system. However, a potential epistemic privileging of AI in clinical judgements may lead to unintended consequences that could negatively affect patient treatment, well-being and rights. The implications are also relevant to precision medicine, digital twin technologies and predictive analytics generally. We propose that a commitment to epistemic humility can help promote judicious clinical decision-making at the interface of big data and AI in psychiatry.},

	abstract = {Facial expressions are of major importance in understanding the mental and emotional states of others. So far, most studies on the perception and comprehension of emotions have used isolated facial expressions as stimuli; for example, photographs of actors displaying facial expressions corresponding to one of the so called ‘basic emotions.’ However, our real experience during social interactions is different: facial expressions of emotion are mostly perceived in a wider context, constituted by body language, the surrounding environment, and our beliefs and expectations. Already in the early twentieth century, the Russian ﬁlmmaker Lev Kuleshov argued that such context, established by intermediate shots of strong emotional content, could signiﬁcantly change our interpretation of facial expressions in ﬁlm. Prior experiments have shown behavioral effects pointing in this direction, but have only used static images as stimuli. Our study used a more ecological design with participants watching ﬁlm sequences of neutral faces, crosscut with scenes of strong emotional content (evoking happiness or fear, plus neutral stimuli as a baseline condition). The task was to rate the emotion displayed by a target person’s face in terms of valence, arousal, and category. Results clearly demonstrated the presence of a signiﬁcant effect in terms of both valence and arousal in the fear condition only. Moreover, participants tended to categorize the target person’s neutral facial expression choosing the emotion category congruent with the preceding context. Our results highlight the context-sensitivity of emotions and the importance of studying them under ecologically valid conditions.},

	abstract = {Depression is one of the most common comorbidities of many chronic medical diseases including cancer and cardiovascular, metabolic, inflammatory and neurological disorders. Indeed, the prevalence of depression in these patient groups is often substantially higher than in the general population, and depression accounts for a substantial part of the psychosocial burden of these disorders. Many factors can contribute to the occurrence of comorbid depression, such as shared genetic factors, converging biological pathways, social factors, health behaviours and psychological factors. Diagnosis of depression in patients with a medical disorder can be particularly challenging owing to symptomatic overlap. Although pharmacological and psychological treatments can be effective, adjustments may need to be made for patients with a comorbid medical disorder. In addition, symptoms or treatments of medical disorders may interfere with the treatment of depression. Conversely, symptoms of depression may decrease adherence to treatment of both disorders. Thus, comprehensive treatment plans are necessary to optimize care.},

              Climate warming has changed the spatial distributions and temporal behaviours of several taxa. A key question that remains is how behaviours that alter microclimatic conditions might be used to buffer the effects of climate change. In this study, we focus on the aggregation behaviour of four species of terrestrial isopods, in which groups of individuals clump together to prevent moisture-loss, and use a laboratory protocol to investigate the effects of changes in relative humidity (RH) and temperature on aggregation. We find that three species aggregate more at lower RH and at higher temperatures, and that species that are better adapted to reducing moisture loss aggregate less than do species with fewer such adaptations. These results suggest that behavioural variation can buffer the effects of changes in microclimate. We finish by suggesting that it is critical to determine how such behavioural shifts will affect isopod densities and competitive hierarchies.},

	abstract = {Abstract
              Foraging behaviour of Armadillidium vulgare was observed in laboratory arenas in which the spatial distribution of patches of high quality food (powdered dicotyledonous leaf litter) was varied within a background of low quality food (powdered grass leaf litter). The hypotheses that the foraging behaviour and foraging path of A. vulgare would be influenced by food quality and the patchiness of high quality food resources were tested. More time was spent in high quality food patches than in low quality food backgrounds than expected by chance in all heterogeneity treatments, but an increasingly higher percentage of time was spent in low quality food as the high quality food became more clumped in space. More time was spent searching, but less time was spent feeding in low quality food backgrounds than in high quality food patches in all the treatments. Walking speed was found to be lower in high quality food patches than in low quality food backgrounds and this was not affected by treatment. Turning frequency and turning angle were found to be higher in high quality food patches than in low quality backgrounds. Turning frequency in low quality food backgrounds decreased as the high quality food became more clumped in space, whereas turning angle in high quality food patches significantly increased in the patchy, but then decreased again in the clumped treatment. The effects of varying the spatial heterogeneity of high quality foods on the trade-off between costs of searching and intake benefits for saprophages are discussed in relation to predictions from optimal foraging theory for circumstances when intake rate maximisation is affected by the constraint of limited nutrients.},
